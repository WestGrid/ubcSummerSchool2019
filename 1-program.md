<!-- streaming: -->
<!-- - Garth will decide in the next few days whether he is going to broadcast one or two sessions, and on the -->
<!--   streaming platform (choice between Vidyo and another one). By Friday we should also know the exact -->
<!--   rooms we’ll be teaching in (either Nest or Pharmaceutical Sciences). That will determine whether we can -->
<!--   bump up the registration cap or not. -->
<!-- - someone will be monitoring the chat / etherpad for questions -->
<!-- - UBCO (Wade) will to try a dedicated room for showing three sessions (cloud, my HPC or bash, one more) -->



<!-- Thursday 4pm 'HPC career panel': Charlotte Fisher will be one of the presenters -->
<!-- likely https://www.sli.do for remote questions -->
<!-- - Roman will do: IP ranges for Eduroam / guest WiFi networks to whitelist them on Cedar (pass these to Lixin) -->
<!-- - wifi access for UBC visitors: Garth will check and get back to me -->
<!-- - already have 120 CCDB guest accounts; will request 10 base CPU-only nodes on Cedar/Graham -->
<!-- - May-22 course helpers: this year no interns, Kamil will start looking into this today -->
<!-- - *Jupyter Notebooks* with Ian Allison (PIMS): initial response is very positive, 50-75% confirmed -->
<!-- - *Elastic cloud and DELL/EMC object storage platform* by Dell (1/2-day hands-on): still working with DELL -->
<!-- - *Building a bioinformatics pipeline with SnakeMake* (3 hours) from Jamie's colleague (Brian?) - let's -->
<!--   assume we can fit it (either cancellation or Stream 3) and ask the instructor for syllabus -->
<!-- - May-22 *CUDA* by Nvidia: asked but likely not -->
<!-- - next meeting Tue June-04 noon at UBC in person -->
<!-- - Bill Tubbs (UBC) would like to teach pandas + scipy for big data processing; decide on June-14 based on Nvidia's response, coordinate possible topic overlap with Ian Allison -->
<!-- - *Web scraping with Python APIs* by Eugene or Skyler (?): they cancelled -->
<!-- - a session from ECOSCOPE (in contact), *Microbiome data manipulation and visualization in R* by Kim Dill-McFarland -->
