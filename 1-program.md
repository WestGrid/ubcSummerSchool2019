All sessions will take place in the Pharmaceutical Sciences Building at 2405 Wesbrook Mall. Please click
on each session title to get detailed information for that course: abstract, prerequisites, software
requirements (if any). Note that we can swap rooms without an email notice based on the latest projected
attendance, so please check this program before coming to class.

We are planning to broadcast most of the sessions in both streams. To watch one of the live streams, if
you are not able to attend in person, please go to <a

during the sessions, starting at 9am Pacific on Monday morning. To ask questions remotely, please use <a

1) or `HPC2` (Stream 2).
