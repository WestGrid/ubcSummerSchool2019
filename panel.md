# Open Panel on Career options, Academia and HPC

**The Panelists**:

- <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~cff" target="_blank">**Charlotte Fisher**</a> is an Affiliate Professor in
  the Department of Computer Science. She is is a Canadian-American applied mathematician and computer
  scientist who gained world recognition for the development and implementation of the
  Multi-Configurational Hartreeâ€“Fock (MCHF) approach to atomic-structure calculations and for her
  theoretical prediction concerning the existence of the negative calcium ion. For this last
  accomplishment, she was elected to grade of Fellow of the American Physical Society.
- <a href="https://www.chem.ubc.ca/mark-thachuk" target="_blank">**Mark Thachuk**</a> is an Associate
  Professor in the Department of Chemistry. His current interests involve the study of the dynamics of
  chemical reactions and processes using mathematical and computational techniques.
- <a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~wachs" target="_blank">**Anthony Wachs**</a> is an Associate Professor in
  the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. He develops
  numerical models to enhance the comprehension of particle-laden flows, a particular class of two-phase
  flows. These models are implemented in massively parallel numerical codes that run on large
  supercomputers (WestGrid computing facilities among others). His research lies at the frontier between
  fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, numerical modelling, applied mathematics and high performance
  computing.
- <a href="https://mageed.arts.ubc.ca" target="_blank">**Muhammad Abdul-Mageed**</a> is an Assistant
  Professor in Computational Linguistics, Information Sciences, and Computer Sciences. His research
  focuses on deep representation learning and natural language socio-pragmatics, with a goal to build
  "social" machines for improved human health, safer social networking, and reduced information overload.

**The Moderators**: UBC ARC Team

<!-- It is my first crack, if you think we need to change the title or anything within the above please feel -->
<!-- free. I think that announcing the panelist and giving some info about them can boost interest and -->
<!-- attendance. I still think that we will have at most 60 ...so the upper mezzanine is o.k. -->

**Time**: Thursday at 4pm, right after the last session of the day (and of the summer school).

Please join our panelists for a discussion in the upper mezzanine level of the Pharmaceutical Sciences
Building (2405 Wesbrook Mall), just above the summer school auditoria.
