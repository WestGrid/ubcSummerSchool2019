# Tensor flow and machine learning

**Instructor**: Griffin Lacey (Nvidia)

In this hands-on course, you will learn the basics of deep learning by training and deploying neural
networks. You will:

- Implement common deep-learning workflows such as Image Classification and Object Detection.
- Experiment with data, training parameters, network structure, and other strategies to increase
  performance and capability.
- Deploy your networks to start solving real-world problems.

On completion of this course, you will be able to start solving your own problems with deep learning.

**Target audience**: general

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: This is an introductory course, no previous experience is required.

**Laptop software**: All attendees will need to bring their laptops with wireless access. You will be
using Nvidia's web-based GPU training platform.
