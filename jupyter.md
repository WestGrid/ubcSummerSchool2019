# Jupyter Notebooks

**Instructor**: Ian Allison (PIMS)

This course will introduce researchers to Jupyter notebooks as a tool for conducting research and for
communicating their work.

The <a href="https://jupyter.org" target="_blank">Jupyter ecosystem</a> is a rich environment for
interactive computing which provides intuitive and powerful tools for data-analysis, computation and
collaboration. We will explore the features of the <a
href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable" target="_blank">jupyter notebook</a> and the
Python programming language. Specifically, we will look at

* Notebook cells: Markdown, Code, Output
* Python syntax: Structures, Loops, Control Flow, Logic

We will then use some popular Python packages (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Sympy, ...)  to work through a
series of examples and exercises to see how they can be used to work with external data sources, produce
insights and visualizations and help create compelling showcases of your work.

**Target audience**: general

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: This course does not have any firm requirements, but some familiarity with Python would be helpful.

**Laptop software**: All attendees will need to bring their laptops with wireless access.
