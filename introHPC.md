# Introduction to high-performance computing (HPC)

**Instructor**: Alex Razoumov (WestGrid)

An introduction to high-performance computing for those without any HPC experience.

We will start with an overview of the hardware of common HPC clusters and a quick description of the
resources available on Compute Canada's national systems (Cedar, Graham, Niagara). We will then continue
learning the basic tools and techniques to work on a cluster: software environment and modules, overview
of installed programming languages and compilers, working with make and Makefiles, and installing new
software locally. Finally, we will take a look at Slurm job scheduler: why use it, fairshare and
priority, submitting serial jobs and job arrays, submitting OpenMP / MPI / hybrid / GPU jobs, working
inside interactive jobs, and tracking your job's memory usage. We will also take a quick look at working
with common packages such as R, Python and Matlab on the clusters, as well as best practices in cluster
workflows.

**Target audience**: general
