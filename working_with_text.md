# Working with Text Data

**Instructor**: Ian Percel (Research Computing Services)

An introduction to basic theory and practical methods for searching text data for complex patterns as well as normalizing text data in preparation for analysis. This course primarily uses Python and the re library to introduce these ideas but they apply with minor modification to many text processing tools.

This course will begin with an introduction to the essential theory of text parsing: text as character arrays, scanning, backtracking, and parse trees. These ideas will provide the context for understanding how we describe patterns in text. By drawing on these ideas, we will be able to introduce the key elements of regular expressions. We will discuss anchors, character classes, grouping, quantifiers, and look-arounds. Regular expressions will be illustrated with practical pattern matching problems on realistic text data. Finally, we will build on our initial examples to develop a custom set of functions for cleaning and normalizing a complex data set. We will also discuss the consequences and limitations of this approach to text normalization.    

**Target audience**: researchers in the social sciences, digital humanities, or anyone who has to use data that includes free text fields 

<!-- **Course plan**: -->

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: This course assumes a familiarity with basic python syntax for variable declaration, function definition and use, and iteration. Some DataFrame syntax will be introduced along the way but knowledge of Pandas is not required.  

**Laptop software**: All attendees will need to bring their laptops with wireless access and with a
remote SSH client installed (on Windows laptops we recommend <a
