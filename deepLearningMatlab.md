# Practical Applications of Deep Learning -- a Hands-on MATLAB Workshop

<!-- original title: Tensor Flow for CNN (Deep Learning) in MATLAB by MathWorks -->

**Instructor**: Reece Teramoto (MathWorks)

Deep learning achieves human-like accuracy for many tasks considered algorithmically unsolvable with
traditional machine learning. It is frequently used to develop applications such as face recognition,
automated driving, and image classification.
 
In this hands-on workshop, you will write code and use MATLAB to:

- Learn the fundamentals of deep learning and understand terms like "layers", "networks", and "loss"
- Build a deep network that can classify your own handwritten digits
- Access and explore various pretrained models
- Use transfer learning to build a network that classifies different types of food
- Learn how LSTM Networks can be used for time-series forecasting
- Train deep learning networks on GPUs in the cloud
- Learn how to use code generation technology to accelerate inference performance
- Learn how to improve the accuracy of deep networks
