# MATLAB Parallel Computing Hands-On Workshop

**Instructor**: Sam Marshalik (MathWorks)

**Helper**: Reece Teramoto (MathWorks)

During this hands-on workshop, MathWorks engineers will introduce you to parallel and distributed
computing in MATLAB with a focus on speeding up your application code and offloading compute. By working
through common scenarios and workflows using hands-on demos, you will gain an understanding of the
parallel constructs in MATLAB, their capabilities, and some of the common hurdles that you'll encounter
when using them. You'll also learn how to run your MATLAB code on Compute Canada resources.

You can download the course materials as a ZIP file (will be available closer to the date of the course).

**Target audience**: Anyone interested in learning more about speedup and parallelizing their MATLAB code.

**Course plan**:
1. Speeding up programs with parallel computing
1. Offloading computations and cluster computing
1. Working with large data sets
1. GPU Computing
1. Running MATLAB on Compute Canada Cedar/Graham resources

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: Taking the self-paced MATLAB Onramp course (2 hours) is recommended. The course can be
<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html" target="_blank">accessed for
free</a>.

**Laptop software**:
- MATLAB R2016a or newer
- Parallel Computing Toolbox
- SSH client

<!-- ideal cluster size for this course: dedicated 4-5 nodes with 32 cores/node and 2 GB/core; number of
cores per node is not particularly important, as long as there are ~80-100 cores in total -->
