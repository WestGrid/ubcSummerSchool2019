# Scientific Visualization

**Instructor**: Alex Razoumov (WestGrid)

We will start with a brief introduction to scientific visualization, and will spend the first hour doing
simple 1D/2D/3D plotting using *plot.ly* open-source Python library. The rest of the day we will study 3D
scientific visualization with ParaView, an open source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization
tool designed to run on a variety of hardware from an individual laptop to large supercomputers. With
ParaView users can interactively visualize 2D and 3D data sets defined on structured, adaptive and
unstructured meshes or particles, animate these datasets in time, and manipulate them with a variety of
filters. ParaView supports both interactive (GUI) and scripted (including offscreen) visualization, and
is an easy and fun tool to learn.

**Target audience**: anyone interested in scientific visualization

<!-- **Course plan**: -->

**Duration**: 6 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: This is an introductory course, no prior visualization experience is required. 

**Laptop software**: This workshop will feature many interactive hands-on exercises, so all attendees
will need to bring their laptops (and perhaps a power cord for use throughout the day) with wireless
access and should have <a href="https://www.paraview.org/download" target="_blank">ParaView installed</a>
before the workshop. If you want to follow *plot.ly* exercises at the beginning of the workshop, we also
recommend installing a remote SSH client (on Windows laptops we recommend <a
href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html" target="_blank">the free edition of MobaXterm</a>; on
Mac and Linux laptops no need to install anything). We will provide all sample data and codes for the
exercises, and you can bring your dataset if you want to visualize it with ParaView. No need to install
*plot.ly* on your laptop -- we will have it installed on our remote cluster.
