**Bio**: Kevin has 10+ years of experience in computational science, and holds a Ph.D. in Physics. He
developed codes solving the quantum physics equations for light absorption by materials, taught workshops
to scientists worldwide, and wrote about high performance computing in the cloud before it was
fashionable. He worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Antwerp, Lausanne, Seattle, and Zurich. He
contributed to the WIEN2k code (Density Functional Theory calculations of material properties,
www.wien2k.at) and the FEFF code (X-ray and Electron absorption spectra, www.feffproject.org). Kevin
joined Amazon in 2015 to help accelerate the adoption of cloud computing in the scientific community
globally.
