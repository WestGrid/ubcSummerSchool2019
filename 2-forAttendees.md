# Instructions for attendees

The morning sessions will take place from 9:00am to noon, and the afternoon sessions from 1:00pm to
4:00pm. All sessions will be in rooms PHRM 1101 and PHRM 1201 (Pharmaceutical Sciences Building)
-- for details please see the [program]({{ site.baseurl }}/1-program.html). The program will continue to
be updated as details are confirmed for room assignments, session times and detailed course information.

If you attend Day 1 morning courses, please arrive early (20-30 mins) to register, as this is the busiest
time at the registration desk. The registration desk will be located just outside rooms PHRM 1101 and
PHRM 1201.

## Linux command line

Please note that most, even beginner's sessions assume a working knowledge of Linux command line. On Day
1 in the morning we will teach an introduction to Linux command line ("Bash Scripting and Tools") for
absolute beginners. If you are new to Linux, we highly recommend attending this session before any other
courses.

## Laptops

**Important**: All attendees must bring their laptops and power cords (if your battery does not last all
day). Don't forget to check details and prerequisites for each course, including software requirements
for your laptop under **Laptop software**. Please install the required software before coming to class.

## WiFi access

You will need online access to log in to remote systems, complete hands-on exercises, view documentation,
etc., so please make sure you can sign in to the campus WiFi. There are several options:

- All UBC students and staff should have access to the local WiFi at the entire campus. Please check that
  it works for you before coming to classes.
- The Eduroam network is free to all academic attendees, whether from UBC or other institutions. To use
  it, you **must obtain your Eduroam account** through your home institution before the start of the
  summer school. If you are not sure how to obtain it, please contact the local IT department at your
  institution.
- There is also self-serve public WiFi available that you can register for once you are in range.

## Cluster accounts

If you have a Compute Canada acount, you are encouraged to use it during the school. We will also be
providing guest accounts. In some of the courses you will be using a training cluster in a virtual
machine (VM), and in some courses you will be running jobs on real Compute Canada production clusters.

## Broadcast

We are planning to broadcast either one or both streams. We will be posting the connection details soon.
