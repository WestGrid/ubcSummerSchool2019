# Instructions for attendees

Morning sessions will be 9:00am-12:00pm. Afternoon sessions will be 1:00pm-4:00pm. The sessions will take
place in CHEM B150, PHRM 3208, ALRD 121, CEME 1202 -- for details please see the [program]({{
site.baseurl }}/1-program.html).

These pages will continue to be updated as details are confirmed for room assignments, session times and
detailed course information.

**Important**: All attendees must bring their laptops and power cords (if your battery does not last all
day). Don't forget to check details and prerequisites for each course, including software requirements
for your laptop under **Setup** > *Laptop software*. Please install the required software before coming
to class.

Before the start of the summer school **all eligible attendees must obtain**:

1. Their Compute Canada acounts. You can find detailed instructions
   [here](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account). Please
   note that the same Compute Canada account will let you log in to both Cedar and Graham clusters. If
   you are not eligible to apply for a Compute Canada account (especially non-academic attendees), we
   will provide a guest account for you
2. Their Eduroam accounts through their home institutions. You will need online access to complete the
   hands-on exercises, log in to remote systems, view documentation, etc., so please make sure you can
   sign in to Eduroam. If not sure how to obtain it, please contact the local IT department at your
   institution.

Some (but not all) of the sessions will be recorded and broadcast. You can watch these presentations at
<a href="http://www.westgrid.ca/live" target="_blank">our live link</a> and <a href="https://www.sli.do"
target="_blank">ask questions here</a> (enter code **M519**). All recorded presentations will be posted
